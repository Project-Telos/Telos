# Telos Project — Landing Page

This is a responsive, accessible landing page scaffold for the "Telos Project" business.

What’s included:
- `index.html` — main page with sections: hero, features, pricing, about, contact.
- `styles.css` — responsive, modern styles with CSS variables.
- `script.js` — small script for UI interactions and demo form handling.
- `logo.svg` — simple SVG logo used as favicon and brand.

How to run:
1. Clone or copy these files into a folder (e.g., `telos-landing/`).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools required.

Customizations you should consider:
- Replace the placeholder logo (logo.svg) with your official artwork.
- Hook the contact form to a backend (API, Zapier, Formspree, etc.) instead of the demo simulation.
- Update copy, pricing, and feature details to match your offerings.
- Add analytics, performance optimizations, and accessibility testing as needed.

Deployment:
- You can deploy this as static files to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.

License:
- Use freely and adapt for your needs.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate a real contact endpoint (show example with Formspree or Netlify Forms).
- Convert this to a React/Vue/Next app.
- Add responsive image assets and an optimized production build.

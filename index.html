      <ul class="projects">
        <li class="project">
          <h4>£2,500 Aprilia RSV4 Rebuild</h4>
          <p>A full rebuild series documenting the reality of buying one of the cheapest RSV4s in the UK. From teardown to rebuild, mistakes included. Viewers help shape the direction — track or road, modifications, fixes, and priorities.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="project">
          <h4>AliExpress Motorcycle Experiments</h4>
          <p>Testing how far cheap parts can really go. Fairings, components, and eventually entire builds using AliExpress parts. Honest reviews, real-world fitment, and no sugar coating.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="project">
          <h4>DIY vs OEM Tools</h4>
          <p>Designing and 3D-printing specialist motorcycle tools that OEMs charge ridiculous money for. Comparing £150 official tools against £5 DIY alternatives.</p>

        </li>

        <li class="project">
          <h4>Extreme &amp; Experimental Builds</h4>
          <p>Longer-term, more ambitious projects including unusual engine swaps, unconventional ideas, and builds that may or may not work. The point is exploration, not perfection.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="project">
          <h4>Adventure &amp; Payoff Projects</h4>
          <p>Once a bike is finished, using it properly. Including long-distance rides, milestone journeys, and ultimate payoff moments like
